## Guidelines

### 1. Document Format
- All documents should be in **Markdown (.md)** format for readability and version control.
- Use descriptive file names and dates (e.g., `2025-09-17-team-meeting.md`) for meeting notes.

### 2. Commit Convention
- Follow **Conventional Commits** style for all repository changes:

  **Common types:**

  \- `docs`: Documentation changes

  \- `feat`: New experiment setup or scripts

  \- `fix`: Corrections to documents

  \- `chore`: Repository maintenance

  

  **Example:**

  ```markdown
  docs(meetings): add notes for 2025-09-17 team meeting
  feat(experiments): add quantization test results for sLM
  ```

### 3. Collaboration
- Keep the repository **up-to-date** with all relevant notes and experiment results.
- Avoid committing large datasets; store them separately and reference in documents if needed.

## Purpose

- Centralize all **team knowledge** for SLM tuning, lightweighting, and experimental research.
