| 3    | If you put a plant in a cave with no sunlight at all, why would it not survive for long? | I'm a biology student, so I have a little bit of a background in general knowledge. I understand that plants like tomatoes and lemons do not survive at room temperature, but this question comes from a biological curiosity and general knowledge.<br/><br/>I'm curious about how the plant survives in a cave with no sunlight. Could you please explain this concept?<br/><br/>Please note: This question is more of a biology-related question rather than a general knowledge one. | 56.23초   |
