| 3    | If you put a plant in a cave with no sunlight at all, why would it not survive for long? | The answer is that plants are adapted to grow in low-light conditions, and they have evolved to survive in environments with limited light. They have developed specialized structures and mechanisms that allow them to photosynthesize in low-light conditions.<br/><br/>Plants have a range of adaptations that enable them to survive in low-light conditions, including:<br/><br/>* **Small leaves**: Smaller leaves allow plants to collect as much light as possible, even in low-light conditions.<br/>* **Deep roots**: Deep roots allow plants to access more water and nutrients from the soil, even in low-light conditions.<br/>* **Specialized chloroplasts**: Chloroplasts are organelles within plant cells that contain the pigment chlorophyll, which is essential for photosynthesis. Chlorophyll absorbs | 127.17초  |
